* Bison and Flex

  The rules of our Makefile about flex and bison are highly inspired
  of the [[http://lrde.epita.fr/cgi-bin/twiki/view/Vaucanson/Vaucanson][Vaucanson]]'s Makefiles.

* Lexing and Parsing

** CTL

   We follow the rules given by the subject nearly exactly. We allow
   some syntactic sugar with the "NOT". Our parser currently support
   an expression like `!w1' instead of NOT(w1) which is quite heavy
   for our needs (we save 4 characters !).

   In our implementation, we consider AX, EX and all their equivalents
   like keyword of this language. It allows a cleaner method to parse,
   because the distinction between is done only in the lexer, and in the
   parser we just have to use a switch to call the right function.

   We also consider an infinite arity in the parser, and we just pass
   a list of argument to the method. Each method is responsible of the
   number of argument they receive, and must print an error if this
   number is wrong.
